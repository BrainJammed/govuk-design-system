Ask users for their card details to let them pay for something.

![A form entitled enter card details which asks for a card number, an expiry date, a name on the card and the card security code. There is a payment summary to the right of the form which says that the total payment amount is 20 pounds.](card-payments.png)

## When to use this pattern

Before using this pattern, check if [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/) is suitable for your service. 

If you need to build your own payment service, follow this pattern to collect payment card details from your users. 

## How it works

### Allow different formats

Let users enter payment card numbers in whatever format is familiar to them. Allow additional spaces, hyphens and dashes.

### Help users enter valid card information

Show logos for the cards you accept as icons. 

Use issuer identification number (IIN) lookups to validate the card number as the user enters it. Once you’ve been able to identify the user’s card type, leave only the relevant logo highlighted and grey out the others.

  <source src="card-number.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

When you validate the card number, the card security code information should update according to the type of card being used. For example, if a user enters an American Express card, the hint text and icon should change to match the front of the card.

The top image shows an input where the security code is the last 3 digits on the back of the card, with hint text and an icon showing that. The bottom image shows an input where the security code is the last 4 digits after the card number on the front, with hint text and an icon showing that.](card-security-code.jpg)

Do not use CVV or other acronyms for the card security code. 

### Show a payment summary

Include a summary of what the user is paying for and how much they are paying on the page where they enter their card numbers. 

## Research on this pattern

This pattern is based on the one used in [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/), which has been live since November 2016. 

The GOV.UK Pay team tests this pattern quarterly as part of its user research.
